# Quantum Probability Distribution

This project is dedicated to show the intuition behind encoding probability distributions onto quantum states and implement APIs for sampling using Qiskit.

## How to build

This built on top of Qiskit. If you want to build it yourself, there is a `requirements.txt` file with all the dependencies.

`pip install -r requirements`

## Bernoulli Random Variables

## Binomial Distribution

## Normal Distribution (Gaussian)
