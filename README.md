# Quantum Probability Distribution

This project is dedicated to implement simulator APIs for probability distributions for quantum computers, some of them may contain a explicit probability calculator.

## How to build

This project uses primarly qiskit. If you want to build it yourself, there is a `requirements.txt` file with all the dependencies.

`pip install -r requirements`

## Binomial Distribution Example
